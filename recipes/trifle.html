    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ripe figs, halved</li>
      <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
      <li>1 orange, juiced</li>
      <li>240g shop-bought ginger cake</li>
      <li>50ml spiced rum (optional)</li>
      <li>397g can caramel</li>
      <li>2 balls of stem ginger, finely chopped, plus 3 tbsp syrup from the jar</li>
      <li>900ml double cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.</li>
      <li>Place the figs in a baking dish cut-side up, then sprinkle over the sugar and squeeze over the orange juice.</li>
      <li>Bake for 10 mins until the figs have softened and are juicy but still holding their shape and then leave to cool.</li>
      <li>Cut the ginger cake into 1cm-thick slices, then use these to line the base of a 1.5-litre trifle bowl in a single layer (you may need to cut these to fit; reserve any pieces you donâ€™t use).</li>
      <li>Arrange the figs around the edge so the cut sides can be seen through the glass (reserve a few figs for the top).</li>
      <li>Pour most of the the roasting juices from the figs over the cake layer along with the rum, if using.</li>
      <li>Mix the caramel with the stem ginger and gently spread half of this over the cake layer using the back of a spoon or a spatula.</li>
      <li>Pour the cream and ginger syrup into a large bowl and whisk until the cream is lightly whipped and just holding its shape.</li>
      <li>Spread half the whipped cream over the caramel layer, then top with any remaining ginger cake pieces, the rest of the caramel and remaining cream.</li>
      <li>Top with the reserved figs and drizzle over any remaining roasting juices. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.</li>
    </ol>
